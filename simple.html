      Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the
      Internet. These resources include tools and applications like data
      storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. Rather than keeping
      files on a proprietary hard drive or local storage device, cloud-based
      storage makes it possible to save them to a remote database. As long as an
      electronic device has access to the web, it has access to the data and the
      software programs to run it.
